## Project Overview

The **BrightHR Checkout Kata** is designed to simulate a simple checkout system where:
- Each item has a price.
- Special offers apply to certain items based on the quantity purchased.
- Total price calculations reflect both regular and special offer prices.

This system provides flexibility to add new pricing rules and can handle various pricing configurations for different items.

## Features

- **Scan Items**: Scan items by SKU and add them to the checkout.
- **Total Price Calculation**: Calculate total cost of items in the cart, applying special pricing rules where applicable.
- **Custom Pricing Rules**: Define custom pricing rules through a factory-based approach to handle both regular and special pricing conditions.


## Architecture

This project is divided into several modules:

### Services
- **Checkout.cs**: The main checkout class responsible for scanning items, keeping track of the items in the cart, and calculating the total price. Special pricing is applied where configured.
- **Factories/PriceRuleFactory.cs**: Factory to create instances of pricing rules based on item configurations. Determines whether a simple or special pricing rule applies.
  
### Interfaces
- **ICheckout.cs**: Interface for the Checkout class, defining basic operations like `Scan` and `GetTotalPrice`.
- **IPricingRule.cs**: Interface for different pricing rule implementations, ensuring consistency across all rule types.

### Models
- **PricingRule.cs**: Represents a pricing rule configuration, including item details, unit price, and optional special offers.
- **SpecialOffer.cs**: Represents a special offer for an item, including quantity and the special price applicable.

### Pricing Rules
- **SimplePriceRule.cs**: Applies a straightforward price-per-unit model.
- **SpecialPriceRule.cs**: Applies a special pricing rule if the item quantity matches the specified condition for a discount.

### Tests
- **CheckoutUnitTests.cs**: Unit tests for the checkout system, ensuring correct calculations for single items, multiple items, and special pricing rules.
